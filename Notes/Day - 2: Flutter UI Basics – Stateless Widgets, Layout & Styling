âœ… What is a StatelessWidget?
A widget that does not hold any state.

Its UI does not change dynamically once built.

Used when you want to display static content or UI that doesnâ€™t need to be updated.

ðŸ”¸ Example:

dart
Copy
Edit
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Stateless Widget')),
        body: Center(child: Text('Hello, Flutter!')),
      ),
    );
  }
}
âœ… How to create a StatelessWidget in Android Studio?
Type stless and press Tab â€“ this auto-generates the boilerplate.

Replace ClassName with your widget name.

Fill the build() method with your UI.

ðŸ§  Real-life Analogy:
A StatelessWidget is like a printed book page â€“ it doesn't change once printed.

âœ… What is a Container in Flutter?
A box-like widget used to style, position, and size its child.

Can have:

height, width

color

padding, margin (via EdgeInsets)

alignment, decoration

ðŸ”¸ Example:

dart
Copy
Edit
Container(
  height: 100,
  width: 100,
  color: Colors.blue,
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(10),
  margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20),
  child: Text("Box"),
)
âœ… EdgeInsets Types
EdgeInsets.all(value) â†’ All sides

EdgeInsets.only(left: 10, top: 5) â†’ Specific sides

EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 10, vertical: 5) â†’ Pairs of sides

âœ… What is mainAxisAlignment?
Used in Row and Column to align children horizontally or vertically.

Options:

dart
Copy
Edit
MainAxisAlignment.start
MainAxisAlignment.center
MainAxisAlignment.end
MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween

âœ… What is crossAxisAlignment?

âœ… What is SizedBox?
A widget that creates fixed space between elements or gives a widget fixed size.

ðŸ”¸ Example:

dart
Copy
Edit
SizedBox(height: 20)
SizedBox(width: 50)
âœ… What is CircleAvatar?
Used to create circular profile images or initials.

ðŸ”¸ Example:

ðŸŸ¦ Day 2 Summary:
You learned about the static building blocks of Flutter: StatelessWidget, Container, layouts (Row, Column), spacing, and UI widgets like SizedBox, CircleAvatar, and Card.
